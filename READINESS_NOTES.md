# Readiness work: running notes

Branch: `ccr-38f40f12-gq1w8o` (no PR opened). One commit per plan item. Test suite: `npm test` (server) plus browser checks with Playwright where the item is UI.
Newest entries at the bottom. "Decision" lines are judgment calls worth a second look.

## Phase 1: Safety (done, commits 0b27316..cad700e)
- 1 Crash guards, 2 student tokens, 3 limits, 4 Remove/Rename student.
- Decision: `TRUST_PROXY=1` added to render.yaml so the per-IP cap uses the last X-Forwarded-For entry. Not verified against Render.
- Decision: with a class list, picking a disconnected student's initials still lets a new device take over (by design), but rotates the token.
- Rename is not offered for class-list students (their name comes from the list).
